# Deployment and Authentication Setup

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- AWS account and configured AWS CLI
- GitHub repository with your React application
- Google Developer account with a registered app and client ID

## Deployment Steps

1. Install AWS Amplify CLI:

   ```
   npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
   ```

2. Initialize Amplify in your project:

   ```
   amplify init
   ```

3. Set up hosting and connect your GitHub repository via the Amplify Console

4. Add authentication to your Amplify project:

   ```
   amplify add auth
   ```

5. Push your changes to AWS:

   ```
   amplify push
   ```

6. Commit and push your changes to GitHub. Amplify will automatically start a new build.

## Monitoring and Managing Your Deployment

1. Go to the AWS Amplify Console in your browser.
2. Select your app to view its status, deployment history, and settings.
3. You can manually redeploy, view logs, and manage environment variables from here.

Remember, with continuous deployment set up, pushing changes to your connected GitHub branch will automatically trigger a new build and deployment in Amplify.
