# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Claude prompts

I started by building out the Solitaire game mostly by hand, and then using Claude / cursor to implement
the final features like moving cards to the foundations and winning the game.

Now, I would like to extend the application with the following features:

1. Use react router to create a home page that has a link to the solitaire game and links to future games, all defined in this repository
2. Implement the game of Durac by extending existing components and adding new components as needed
3. I will define all the game states and rules to be implemented, as well as underlying data model
4. I will use AWS DynamoDB to store game states and user information and feed that context to Claude

# Data Model

Mostly context specific for Durac but the Player class can easily be extended to other games.

User (Use Google Auth IDP)

- id
- name
- email
- createdAt
- updatedAt

Game

- id
- users
- gameType
- gameState
- inProgress

GameState

- id
- player
- deck
- discardPile
- createdAt
- updatedAt
- attackSlots
- primaryAttacker
- defender

Player

- id
- userId
- hand

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
